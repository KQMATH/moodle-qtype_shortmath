# ShortMath
A simple question for simple mathematical expressions using MathQuill.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath)

## What is it?
The plugin is based on the short answer question type, but the students
enter their response in a maths editor.  The studen interface is WYSIWYG
(what you see is what you get).

The editor interface is provided by MathQuill, which produces LaTeX
code which is used as the internal representation.  Rendering relies
on MathJax which provides mathematically correct visual rendering.
Auto-grading, if desired, is based on syntactic string match on the
LaTeX code.

ShortMath has been designed for use with JazzQuiz, where auto-grading is 
not used.  Thus auto-grading has not been tested, and syntactic matching
of maths formulæ may or may not be practical.
