# ShortMath
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KQMATH/moodle-qtype_shortmath)

A simple question for mathematical expressions using MathQuill.

## What is it?
The plugin is based on the short answer question type, but the students
enter their response in a maths editor. The student interface is WYSIWYG
(what you see is what you get).

The editor interface is provided by MathQuill, which produces LaTeX
code that is used as the internal representation. Rendering relies
on MathJax which provides mathematically correct visual rendering.


ShortMath has been designed for use with JazzQuiz, where auto-grading is 
not used. However, if desired, auto-grading based on syntactic string match on the
LaTeX code is supported.
